# DBMS_Project

In our project, on HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, we have tried to show how the Data in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels. This has been achieved by dividing the project into various modules. Customer is provided with different services like checking in,checking out, payments etc. Enquiry about customer can be done by customer Id. Enquiry about different categories of rooms available can also be made. It will generate reports for customer and bill for customers.

The software has been designed with backend as PHP.
